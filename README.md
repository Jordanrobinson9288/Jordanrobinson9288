# Welcome to My Frontend Workshop 👋

**Sophomore in Computer Software Technology | Senior UX/UI Designer Transitioning to Development**

Hello! I'm Jordan Robinson, a dedicated student at the University of Arizona Global Campus (UAGC) pursuing a **Bachelor of Science in Computer Software Technology**. I'm on a mission to bridge the gap between design and development.

With over **a decade of experience as a Senior UX/UI Designer**, I possess a deep understanding of user-centric design principles, wireframing, and prototyping. Now, I'm building the technical skills to bring those designs to life with clean, efficient code. My unique perspective allows me to not only build functional websites but to engineer intuitive and engaging user experiences from the ground up.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Interests

- **🌱 Currently Learning & Using:** I'm actively advancing my skills in front-end development, with a strong focus on **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript,** and **Bootstrap** for rapid, responsive prototyping.
- **🔮 On The Horizon:** I am excited to dive into modern front-end frameworks and see **React.js** in my near future as the next step in my learning journey.
- **🎨 Design Foundation:** My work is informed by years of expertise in design tools like Figma, Adobe XD, and a user-first philosophy.

## 📂 About This Repository

This repo is my public learning lab—a collection of my front-end projects, code experiments, and practice exercises. Here, I apply the theoretical knowledge from my degree to practical, hands-on coding.

You'll find:
- **Bootstrap-Powered Projects:** Demonstrating my ability to build responsive and modern layouts quickly.
- **Frontend Code Snippets:** Exploring the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Learning Progress:** A timeline of my growth as I transition from a designer who understands code to a developer who speaks the language of design.

## 🎯 My Goal

My aim is to become a proficient **Front-End Developer** with the rare ability to seamlessly collaborate with design teams or take a project from a wireframe to a fully functioning, polished web application. I believe that the best digital products are created when design and development are in harmony.
