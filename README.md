# Welcome to My Coding Journey ðŸš€

Hi, I'm **Jordan Robinson**. For over a decade, I've been passionate about building user experiences as a **UX/UI Designer**. Now, I'm expanding my craft to the code that brings those experiences to life as an **Aspiring Full-Stack Developer**.

I believe great applications are born at the intersection of elegant design and robust code. My mission is to master Java and full-stack development to become a builder who understands the entire process, from pixel to pipeline.

## ðŸ§  My Current Focus

I am currently enrolled in the **Amazon Career Choice Full-Stack Developer certificate program** on Coursera, building a comprehensive skill set in modern web development. My primary focus is mastering **Java programming** and its application in backend systems, while strengthening my front-end expertise.

**My Toolkit:**
- **Backend Focus:** `Java`, `Object-Oriented Programming`, `Spring Boot`
- **Web Fundamentals:** `JavaScript` | `HTML5` | `CSS3` | `SASS`
- **Design Expertise:** `Figma` | `Adobe XD` | `User Research` | `Wireframing`

## ðŸŒŸ Why My Background is an Asset

My 10 years in design (2013-2023) mean I don't just write code; I architect solutions with a deep empathy for the end-user. I ask questions like:
* "Is this interface intuitive?"
* "How does this function impact the user's workflow?"
* "Is this accessible and performant?"

I'm learning to translate the *'why'* behind a design into clean, functional, full-stack code.

## ðŸ“‚ About This Repo

This is my digital workshop. Here you'll find:
- **Learning Projects:** Exercises and small apps built while mastering new concepts in Java and full-stack development.
- **Code Experiments:** Sandboxes for testing ideas and exploring technologies from my certificate program.
- **Future Portfolio Pieces:** As my skills grow, this will house more complex, deployed full-stack applications.

## âœ¨ My Journey, So Far
My tech career has been a coast-to-coast adventure! It began in the tech hubs of **Seattle, WA**, and took me through the vibrant scene of **Atlanta, GA**, followed by the growing market in **Brandon (Tampa), FL**. Originally from the Detroit, MI area, I've now brought my passion for building to the sunny desert of **Sun City, Arizona**. I'm excited to see where this next chapter in coding takes me!
